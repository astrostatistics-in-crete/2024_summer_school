    "\n",
    "### Step 3. The statistic, $Z$-score\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: since we know it, we use the population standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to decide whether the sample mean is consistent with the model's prediction, we must compute the **distribution of the sample mean given that the model is correct.**\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma_{\\bar{x}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{N}}$$\n",
